# AD-Badge-Bot
 This bot will give you the active developer badge on your discord profile.

 When installing the bot, you need a couple of things to run it.

 Node.js
 A brain :D

 When you have installed the code, you will need to extract the zip.

 Once you have done that, open up command prompt and "npm i" in there and let it down load the packages required for the bot to run.

 Once you have done that, go into the index.js file and input the 2 things it asks you for.
 
 You will require a bot application which you can get at https://discord.com/developers/applications you can also generate a URL on that page, you need to go to OAuth2 and go URL generator. You will need the bot and applications.command option selected.

 After you have created the bot put in the token where it requires it in the index.js file. Ensure to also put the server ID in where it needs it otherwise the command probably won't show.

 Run "node ." in the command prompt and it should start the bot.
 
 I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANYTHING TO DO WITH THIS, I HAVE WRITTEN THE PROJECT FOR EVERYONE BUT IF ANYTHING HAPPENS TO YALL, NOT MY FAULT.
